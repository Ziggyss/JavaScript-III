/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. The default value of 'this' is the Window Binding. This means that outside of a function, or within a normal function, the word 'this' points to the window.

* 2. Implicit Binding is when 'this' is contained within a function that is called as a method. In this scenario, 'this' refers to the object that the method is being called on.

* 3. New Binding refers to when a Constructor function is being called. In this case, 'this' refers to the object that the constructor is creating.

* 4. Explicit Binding: in the case of invoking functions with call and apply, or copying functions with bind, you can assign 'this' within the brackets to whatever you want. 
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
